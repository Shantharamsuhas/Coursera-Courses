Neural Networks and Deep learning and Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization are two courses of the Deep Learning Speacialization series provided by the MOOC Coursera. It is taught by Prof.Andrew Ng of Stanford Unviersity and is the goto course for people starting out in Deep learning.

Neural Network and Deep learning includes topic like Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, different activation functions etc and caps off each week by having programming assignment on the explained topic. It finishes off with an implementatin of deep neural network to recognise cat vs non-cats.


Improving Deep Neural Networks: In this course hyperparameter tuning , regularization , optimization are explained and how implementaion of these effect the nural network.

Convolutional Neural Networks : It is the fourth course of the Deep Learning Specialization. Things learnt include : How to build a convolutional neural network , ResNets, use neural style transfer to generate art ,became familiar with its exciting applications such as autonomous driving, face recognition
